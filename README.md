## Using local paypal-checkout-components

This repo uses the button renderer from [github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components](https://github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components). To pull in local changes from `paypal-checkout-components` to this module:

- Clone and set up the [github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components](https://github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components) repo
- Run this module with `BUTTON_RENDER_DIR=/path/to/paypal-checkout-components npm start`
- Load http://localhost/smart/buttons?clientID=alc_client1 in your browser

## Preflight call

This section is relevant to integrations passing `data-user-id-token`, for vaulted/one-click button renders.

Rendering the vaulted button can be time consuming. The Smart Buttons server allows a pre-flight call to be made. This pre-caches the button, ready to be rendered immediately when the buyer lands on your page. This should typically be done in one of the following places:

- On a page immediately prior to displaying the Smart Buttons
- On a single-page app prior to displaying the Smart Buttons, if the Smart Buttons are displayed after a user action
- On the server-side prior to rendering the cart or checkout page containing the Smart Buttons

To invoke, simply make a call to the following URL:

```bash
https://www.paypal.com/smart/buttons/preload?client-id=CLIENT_ID&user-id-token=ID_TOKEN
```

The following URL params can be passed:

- `client-id`: (required) Your PayPal client id
- `user-id-token`: (required) Your customer's id token
- `merchant-id` (optional) The merchant id or email of the transaction payee
- `amount`: (optional) The estimated amount of the transaction
- `currency`: (optional) The currency of the transaction

This request can be made as a fire-and-forget call: you do not need to wait for a response, or check the status code of the response.
